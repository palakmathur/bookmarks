## Div vs Section

* [Section](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/section) used for grouping thematically related content. 
* [Div](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/div) "has no meaning at all"
* <i>Is all the content related</i> &ndash; [Jeremy Kieth](http://www.abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers)

## Document Outlines

* 7 tags define new outline contexts `body`, `section`, `article`, `aside`, `footer`, `header`, `nav`&ndash;Each of these can have their own h1 [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document)
* Also includes `main`, `figure`, `time`

## Header

* [Group of introductory or navigational aids.](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/header)
* There can be more than 1 on a page
* based on content not on position

## Footer
* [represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element.](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/footer)
* Can be present within any of the sectioning Elements

## Aside:

* [tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content.](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/aside)
* within an `article` should be related to content within that element
* Outside an aticle should be related to the <em>whole site</em>
